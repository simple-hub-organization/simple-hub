# @project-chip/matter.js

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With matter.js 0.11.0 the package structure was adjusted. This package is exposing the current API for Controller implementations (a new API will follow soon) and the Legacy Device building Node API and mainly contains compatibility re-exports. Please adjust your code to just use the relevant exports from here and switch for all other matter.js general packages to the @matter/main package.

Implementation of Matter protocol in typescript with no native dependencies (and very limited dependencies).

This is the JavaScript-only Core of the Matter protocol. It is used by other projects to implement Matter Nodes and Clients and add the relevant specific implementations for Network and other elements.

> This package supports all Node.js LTS versions starting with 18.x

The following features are abstracted away to allow to be implemented environment specific:

-   Network (UDP/MDNS)
-   Crypto
-   Storage
-   Date/Timer
-   Logger (Default uses "console")
-   Environment (Process and Configuration handling)

## Exported functionality

This library exports the Matter protocol functionality as well as some helper functions as named exports:

Both exports and the typings are exported as CommonJS and ES6 modules.

For more details please refer to the [API Documentation](../../docs/README.md).

For more details see the [main package](../main/README.md) documentation.

### Typescript note

To have Typescript and your IDE know all the relevant exported functionality you need to use the following in your tsconfig.json:

```json5
{
    compilerOptions: {
        moduleResolution: "node16", // Required to support package.json exports
        module: "node16", // Required to make sure all imports are js
    },
}
```

Additionally, we recommend using `"strictNullChecks": true` or better for code quality `"strict": true` to make sure that all types are correctly determined.

## Building

-   `npm run build`: Build all code and create CommonJS and ES6 variants in dist directory. This will built incrementally and only build the changed files.
-   `npm run build-clean`: Clean the dist directory and build all code from scratch

## Tests

-   `npm run test`: Run all tests
